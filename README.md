**** *DISCLAIMER about the version / step numbering:* ****
The steps in the Blueprint are organized by software version.
That might be misleading, and here's why: 

Each "major" QuickShape version is independently stable -- 
but each step *between* versions doesn't necessarily result 
in a stable, usable version of the software. 

If you're doing [software versioning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_versioning)
for public software, all version updates -- both major and minor --  
should be stable.  That's how versions usually work. 

The type of "in-development" versioning used in the Blueprint
could be called [internal project versioning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_versioning#Internal_version_numbers).
