# 📐 QuickShapes

A library to draw shapes in the text terminal.  

<br /><br />

QuickShapes has two sections of docs -- the 🗺 [Blueprint](#blueprint) and the 📖[User Guide](#user-guide).

If you're looking to use QuickShapes in your project, but don't need to know the
technical details, the 📖 User Guide is for you.

If you want a step-by-step tutorial on how to remake QuickShapes
described in a series of well-detailed steps, then you're looking for the 🗺 Blueprint.
