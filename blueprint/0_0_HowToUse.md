Hi!  Thanks for reading the QuickShapes blueprint! 

The *software* goal is to display shapes graphed nicely. 

But the goal of the blueprints is to study and document the 
production process of a NodeJS module.  
That means planning, coding, testing, and releasing updated versions.

## How to use the Blueprint

Feel free to use the Blueprint however you'd like. Obviously.

Here are some recommended options:

 - Follow along step-by-step to recreate your own shape-drawing JS tool! 
 
   You'll need a [computer with nodeJS](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/10475651/how-to-tell-if-node-js-is-installed-or-not).
   A coding background will help, but with a little patience, this could
   be a decent introduction to Javascript. 
   
   ( And if that makes it sound boring, just skim til part 1.0. )
   
 - Start anywhere and skim.  *Todo: link to some interesting bits*
 
 - Use the Blueprint as a lesson plan, or something.
   Teaching pals to code? Nice.

Oh shit that's the bell, we gotta get to [Programming 101 ☞](https://github.com/rooftop-media/shapes/blob/main/blueprint/0_1_Programming101.md).

Ok here's the other reason I'm making this Blueprint:

I'm not really sure how this whole "git clone" business works.
So,  in case i accidentally delete my local copy of this repo,  
these instructions will let me remake the code from scratch.

Or like if I need to send QuickShapes to my friend who also doesn't
understand git clone, I can just link them here, and they can
remake it.  It's like a really slow [VCS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Version_control).  

Oh yeah also I don't know about copying and pasting.  

If anyone knows anything about copy/pasting, or downloading your files from
github, please send me a fax.  Thank you.
