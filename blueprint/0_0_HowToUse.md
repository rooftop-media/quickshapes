Hi!  Thanks for reading the QuickShapes blueprint! 

The *software* goal is to display shapes graphed nicely. But
the goal of the blueprints is to study the production process
of a NodeJS module.  That means planning, coding, testing, and
releasing updated versions.

Feel free to read however you'd like, obviously.  Some options:

 - Follow along step-by-step to recreate your own shape-drawing JS tool! 
   You'll need a [computer with nodeJS](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/10475651/how-to-tell-if-node-js-is-installed-or-not).
   A coding background will help, but if you read from the beginning, QuickShapes

Also, I'm not really sure how this whole "git clone" business works.
So,  in case i accidentally delete my local copy of this repo, i figured 
id just leave thorough instructions on how to remake the code from scratch.

Oh yeah also I don't know about copying and pasting.  

If anyone knows anything about copy/pasting, or downloading your files from
github, please send me a fax.  Thank you.
