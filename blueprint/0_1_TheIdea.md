> *You look at your to-do list.  Near the top, it says:*

###  QuickShapes Version 1.0. Todo List

 - [ ] **1. Explain the idea, plan features.**
 
 <br />
 
> *You decide to try doing that.* 



<br/><br/><br/><br/>



###  Version 1.0 Description & Features

QuickShapes is library to draw shapes to the text terminal. 

###  Shape drawing features include:

 - Draw a `triangle` or a `square`. 
   *Just two for now.*

 - Choose a number for `width`. 
   *Sides will be equal for now, too.*

 - Choose the text used to draw. 
   *Default: "`* ""

 - Choose to fill or not fill the shape.
   *Non-filled shapes are just outlined.*
  
<br/><br/>
  
> *And you're feeling extra, so you make a table to illustrate the planned features too.*

> *These will be the **functions** that you'll **export** with the release of QS Version 1.0.
 

| Function name                               | Argument types            | Description        | 
|---------------------------------------------|---------------------------|--------------------| 
| `draw_square( width, draw_text, filled )`   | int, string, boolean      | Draws a square     | 
| `draw_triangle( width, draw_text, filled )` | int, string, boolean      | Draws a triangle   | 

> *Two functions isn't much, but this is only version 1.0.  
> *If things go well, you can always add more*


  
<br/><br/><br/><br/>

> *That's probably good enough for now.*  
> *You'll go back and add details when you have a coded product.*
