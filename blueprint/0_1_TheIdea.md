###  Todo List  ( QuickShape v 1.0. )

 - [ ] **1. Explain the idea, plan features.**
 
 <br /> <br />

 
> *You decide to try doing that.* 


<br/><br/><br/><br/>



###  Version 1.0 Description & Features

QuickShapes is library to draw shapes to the text terminal. 

###  Shape drawing features include:

 - Draw a `triangle` or a `square`.  
   *Just two for now.*

 - Choose a number for `width`.  
   *Sides will be equal for now, too.*

 - Choose the text used to draw.  
   *Default: "`* `"

 - Choose to fill or not fill the shape.  
   *Non-filled shapes are just outlined.*
  
<br/><br/>
  
> *And you're feeling extra, so you make a **table**, too.*
> *It lists the QuickShape **functions**.*

<br />

###  Exported Functions ( QS Version 1.0. )

This table describes the [JS functions](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_functions.asp) that QuickShape defines.
The "Argument types" column indicates what [JS datatype](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_datatypes.asp) each argument expects.
 
| Function name                               | Argument types            | Description           | 
|---------------------------------------------|---------------------------|-----------------------| 
| `draw_square( width, draw_text, filled )`   | number, string, boolean   | Draws a square!       | 
| `draw_triangle( width, draw_text, filled )` | number, string, boolean   | Draws a triangle!     | 

> *Two functions isn't much, but this is only version 1.0.*
> *If things go well, you can always add more*


  
<br/><br/><br/><br/>

> *That's probably good enough for now.*  
> *You'll go back and add details when you have a coded product.*
