The library we'll be making is pretty simple.  
It prints shapes to your console.

This guide will tell you how to make it!


```javascript

draw_square(8, 4);
/*  output:
********
********
********
********
*/

draw_triangle(5, 5)
*****
****
***
**
*

```




Hi!  Thanks for reading the QuickShapes blueprint! 


The *software* goal is to display shapes graphed nicely. 

But the goal of the *blueprints* is to study and document the 
production process of a NodeJS module.  

That means notes on planning, coding, testing, and releasing 
updated versions.

## How to use the Blueprint

Feel free to use the Blueprint however you'd like. Obviously.

 
 along step-by-step to recreate your own shape-drawing JS tool! 
 
   You'll need a [computer with nodeJS](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/10475651/how-to-tell-if-node-js-is-installed-or-not).
   A coding background will help, but with a little patience, this could
   be a decent introduction to Javascript. 
   
   ( And if that makes it sound boring, just skim til part 1.0. )
   
 - Start anywhere and skim.  *Todo: link to some interesting bits*
 
 - Use the Blueprint as a lesson plan, or something.
   Teaching pals to code? Nice.
