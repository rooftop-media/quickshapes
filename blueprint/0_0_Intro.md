*You find yourself **itching to program** some software...*

*It'd be nice to code something other people might use.
Ideally something **pretty**, but **simple** --  
you admit, you're still a novice programmer.*

*You remember back to a pretty-but-simple coding exercise...*

*Yeah... **Drawing shapes** to the **terminal screen**.  
Using a few for-loops and if-statements, you could make
some scalable geometry art, out of text!*

*The shapes were kinda like...*

<br/><br/>

A `square`, of side length `5`, made of `*`:

```
* * * * * 
* * * * * 
* * * * * 
* * * * * 
* * * * * 
```

A `triangle`, of side length `4`, made of `#`.

```
# 
# # 
# # #
# # # #
```
A `hollow-square`, of side length `5`, made of `~`:

```
~ ~ ~ ~ ~
~       ~
~       ~
~       ~
~ ~ ~ ~ ~
```

*Yeah, like that!*

*And so you decide to give it a shot --*
*you'll write a [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/) package, of **tools** to draw **customizable shapes**.*

*You want it to be a **quick** project, and it's about **shapes**.  
So, you call it **QuickShapes**.*



<br/><br/><br/><br/>



*You find a pen and paper.  Here's what you write: * 

###  QuickShapes Version 1.0. Todo List

 - [ ] 1. Explain the idea, plan features.
 
 - [ ] 2. Coding those features.
 
 - [ ] 3. Build a test.
 
 - [ ] 4. Document, package, & publish.
 
 - [ ] 5. Any revisions
   



<br /><br /><br /><br />

*After a moment of consideration, you decide you're ready to [start step 1](https://github.com/rooftop-media/shapes/blob/main/blueprint/0_1_TheIdea.md#title).*
