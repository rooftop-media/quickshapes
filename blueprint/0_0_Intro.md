<br /><br /><br /><br />


###  Background & Motivation.

> *You find yourself **itching to program** some software...*

> *It'd be nice to code something other people might use.
> Ideally something **pretty**, but **simple** --  
> you admit, you're still a novice programmer.*  

> *Ideally, the software idea would be something both
> pretty and relatively simple.*


<br /><br /><br /><br />


###  Initial Outline.

> *You remember back to a pretty-but-simple coding exercise...*

> *Yeah... **Drawing shapes** to the **terminal screen**.  
> Using a few for-loops and if-statements, you could make
> some scalable geometry art, out of text!*

> *The shapes were kinda like...*

<br/><br/>

A `square`, of side length `5`, made of `*`:

```
* * * * * 
* * * * * 
* * * * * 
* * * * * 
* * * * * 
```

A `triangle`, of side length `4`, made of `#`.

```
# 
# # 
# # #
# # # #
```
A `hollow-square`, of side length `5`, made of `~`:

```
~ ~ ~ ~ ~
~       ~
~       ~
~       ~
~ ~ ~ ~ ~
```

> *Yeah, like that!*

> *And so you decide to give it a shot --*
> *you'll write a [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/) package, of **tools** to draw **customizable shapes**.*

> *You want it to be a **quick** project, and it's about **shapes**.  
> So, you call it **QuickShapes**.*



<br/><br/><br/><br/>



> *You find a pen and paper.  Here's what you write:* 

###  QuickShapes Version 1.0. Todo List

 - [ ] 1. Explain the idea, plan features.
 
 - [ ] 2. Coding those features.
 
 - [ ] 3. Build a test.
 
 - [ ] 4. Document, package, & publish.
 
 - [ ] 5. Any revisions
   



<br /><br /><br /><br />

> *After a moment of consideration, you decide you're ready to [start step 1](https://github.com/rooftop-media/shapes/blob/main/blueprint/0_1_TheIdea.md#title).*
