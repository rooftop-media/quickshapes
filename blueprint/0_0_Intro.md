<br /><br /><br /><br />


###  Background & Motivation.

> *You find yourself **itching to program** some software...*
>
> *It'd be nice to code something other people might use.*  
> *And ideally, something kinda **flashy**, but kinda**simple** --*  
> *you admit, you're still a **novice** programmer.*  

<br />

> *You remember back to a coding exercise you did once...*
> *It was about drawing **shapes** to the **terminal screen**.*
>
> *You remember drawing **squares** and **triangles** to be particularly easy,*   
> *and you remember making the shapes optionally **hollow**, too.*




<br /><br /><br /><br />


###  Initial Outline.

> *Eventually you'll want more than squares and triangles,*  
> *but that seems like a good starting point for version 1.0.*
>
> *You write down some simple examples you can imagine...*

<br/><br/>


###  Example Use:

```javascript

draw_square( 4, "* ", true);

/*** Resulting output:
A `filled square`, of size `4`, made of `* `:

* * * * 
* * * * 
* * * * 
* * * * 

*/

```

```javascript

draw_square( 5, "* ", false);

/*** Resulting output:
A `hollow square`, of size `5`, made of `$ `:

$ $ $ $ $ 
$       $ 
$       $ 
$       $ 
$ $ $ $ $ 

*/

```

```javascript

draw_triangle( 4, "# ", false);

/*** Resulting output:
A `solid triangle`, of side length `4`, made of `# `.

# 
# # 
# # #
# # # # 

*/

```

```javascript

draw_triangle( 6, "@ ", false);

/*** Resulting output:
A `hollow triangle`, of side length `6`, made of `@ `.

@ 
@ @
@   @
@     @
@       @
@ @ @ @ @ @

*/

```

<br/><br/>


> *Sure, those would be very doable! A good starting place.*

> *And so you decide to give it a shot --*  
> *you'll write a [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/) package, of **tools** to draw **customizable shapes**.*

> *You want it to be a **quick** project, and it's about **shapes**.  
> So, you call it **QuickShapes**.*



<br/><br/><br/><br/>



> *You open your favorite document editor and start a new file:*

###  Todo List  ( QuickShape v 1.0. )

 - [ ] 1. Explain the idea, plan features.
 
 - [ ] 2. Coding those features.
 
 - [ ] 3. Build a test.
 
 - [ ] 4. Document, package, & publish.
 
 - [ ] 5. Any revisions
   



<br /><br /><br /><br />

> *After a moment of consideration, you decide you're ready to [start step 1](https://github.com/rooftop-media/shapes/blob/main/blueprint/0_1_TheIdea.md#title).*
