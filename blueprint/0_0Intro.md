Hi!  Thanks for reading the QuickShapes Blueprint! 

This series of documents walks you through the process
of developing a shape-graphing NodeJS library. 

<br /><br /><br /><br />

## How to use the Blueprint


The QuickShape *software* goal is to provide tools to
draw shapes.  That's what you'll be making.

The QuickShape *Blueprints* goal is to study and document 
the production process of a NodeJS module.  The process includes:

 - Planning the code's features.
 
 - Coding those features.
 
 - Testing them out. 
 
 - Revising code when things aren't working. 
   ( The Blueprints build 4 stable versions of QuickShape. )

## How to use the Blueprint

Feel free to use the Blueprint however you'd like, obviously. 
But here are some suggestions we had in mind:

 - Read or skim through, if any part interests you. 

 - Follow each step to recreate your own shape-drawing JS tool! 
 
   You'll need a [computer with nodeJS](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/10475651/how-to-tell-if-node-js-is-installed-or-not).
   A coding background will help, but with a little patience, this could
   be a decent introduction to Javascript. 
   
   ( And if that makes it sound boring, just skim til part 1.0. )
    
 - Use the Blueprint as a lesson plan, or something.
   Teaching pals to code? Nice.
