Warm up by writing some functions to draw shapes.
Specifically, squares and triangles.

Here's the result we want:

```javascript

//  Call our function to draw a 3x5 square!
draw_square( 3, 5 );
/* output:
*****
*****
*****       */
```
All we'll need is four concepts: functions, for-loops, if-statements, and memory. (?)
